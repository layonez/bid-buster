Lets spin up a full research team to prepare that project to take a first place at @"docs/Hackathon rules.md" hackathon. We would need to understand how project will be
  judjed/by which criterias and what are the best ways to highlight how is our project commited to win in that hackathon. What we did was iterationally appended to
  @docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md , we also already did a kick off for of @docs/PRESENTATION_PLAN.md - which we would need to refine and drive it to the best possible shape according to
  project goals and hackathon specifics. Big part of the project is that I personanly was lacking deep experise in the specific area of gov procurement - and it was a proof of
  concept that enthusiasts now can be empowered by custom made research tools which makes it possible to reach level of experts in the are - to be able to uncover complex cases
  which are known @docs/PRESENTATION_PLAN.md (some described here). so we did extensive research fist how that whole area operates wich opus 4.6 - analised online resources
  and prepared an investigating as a code tool. So first iteration would be for you to create a questionary of what is missing in current project documentation - but what is
  critical to highlight for hackathon in 3 mins demo and that one proj summary - (100–200 words). After that is done we would spin up command of experts to write a demo
  scenario and summary doc

## **Hackathon Rules**

To keep things fair and aligned with our goals, all teams must follow these rules:

- **Open Source:** Everything shown in the demo must be fully open source. This includes every component - backend, frontend, models, and any other parts of the project - published under an approved open source license.

- **New Work Only:** All projects must be started from scratch during the hackathon with no previous work.

- **Team Size:** Teams may have up to **2** members.

- **Banned Projects:** Projects will be disqualified if they: violate legal, ethical, or platform policies, use code, data, or assets you do not have the rights to.

## **4. Problem Statements & Example Projects**

**Problem Statement One:** Build a Tool That Should Exist — Create the AI-native app or workflow you wish someone had already built. Eliminate busywork. Make hard things effortless.

**Example Projects:**

- Contract Lifecycle Autopilot - Extracts all obligations from contracts and tracks deadlines with automatic reminders

- Product Changelog Publisher - Turns release notes into customer-facing announcements across multiple channels

- Bug Report Enricher - Automatically adds system logs, user history, and reproduction steps to support tickets

**Problem Statement Two:** Break the Barriers — Expert knowledge, essential tools, AI's benefits — take something powerful that's locked behind expertise, cost, language, or infrastructure and put it in everyone's hands.

**Example Projects:**

- Crop Doctor — Combines image analysis, weather data, and soil reports to diagnose plant diseases and recommend organic treatment protocols.

- Accessibility Auditor — Evaluates websites, documents, and physical spaces against accessibility standards and generates remediation plans.

- Open Source Hardware Guide — Helps makers navigate component selection, PCB design, and manufacturing for hardware projects.

**Problem Statement Three:** Amplify Human Judgment — Build AI that makes researchers, professionals, and decision-makers dramatically more capable — without taking them out of the loop. The best AI doesn't replace human expertise. It sharpens it.

**Example Projects:**

- Brand Safety Monitor - Reviews ad placements and content adjacencies, flagging reputation risks for marketing teams

- Discovery Anomaly Detector - Flags documents in discovery that should exist but are missing based on references in other documents

- Grading Calibration Partner — Highlights scoring inconsistencies in instructor assessments, supporting but not overriding professional judgment on standards.

we are working on the project for Anthropics                              
      hackathon to utilize the most capabilities of                         
      their new Frontier Opus 4.6 model. Our project is                         
      described in the @docs/project_description.md . that                  
    project description is not final, and we still need to                      
    brainstorm and work based on the knowledge base we have                 
    defined in @docs/ . Alongside with multiple knowledge base              
    files, we have additional folder with references to be used             
    when we have any question about implementation, about rules,            
    we can investigate and research those referenced projects to            
    find inspiration and clear path to resolve issues based on              
    already existent solved problems @references/references.md .            
    So, our first goal is to create a project plan to implement             
    an impressive tool which which utilizes all of the latest               
    frontier model capabilities, which enhance all of the                   
    existing tools and provides a holistic analysis of the                  
    procurement data to find, to highlight and find issues in a             
    way that it would be easily validatable and clear for                   
    everyone if there's any malicious activity. That plan should            
    for sure include a stage where we use public APIs, use the              
    tools to understand How we can utilize those what are, what             
    is the actual data that we would need to work with. and then            
    after analysis phase we can proceed to the repository setup             
    tools Different phases like POC MVP and and then later                  
    project stages. so let's create a holistic analysis for that            
    project and output a complete project plan that we later can            
    follow.

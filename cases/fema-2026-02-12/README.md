# Procurement Investigation: Federal Emergency Management Agency

**Period:** 2020-03-01 to 2020-12-31
**Generated:** 2026-02-12

During the March-December 2020 COVID-19 emergency response period, FEMA executed 7,259 procurement actions totaling nearly $4 billion that warrant administrative review. The most significant pattern involves PARKDALE ADVANCED MATERIALS, INC. receiving $543.4 million across two non-competitive awards, including a single contract valued at $532.2 million that represents an extreme statistical outlier (56.80 standard deviations above category norms). Additionally, 45.6% of competitively solicited awards to the Department of Homeland Security (1,000 of 2,193 actions worth $1.35 billion) received only a single bid, suggesting potential market access or specification issues. Other concentrated spending includes AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE, INC. capturing $377.4 million across 35 awards and HANESBRANDS INC. receiving a $175 million non-competitive award, all reflecting emergency procurement conditions that merit retrospective compliance assessment.

## Top Findings

### [HIGH] Single-Bid Competition — Department of Homeland Security

**What:** Department of Homeland Security received 2193 competitively solicited awards, with a single-bid rate of 45.6% (1000 awards received only one offer).

**Standard:** FAR 6.101 requires agencies to promote and provide for full and open competition. The EU Single Market Scoreboard flags single-bid rates above 20% as a concern indicator.

**Impact:** $1,374,969,804.96 in awards may not have benefited from competitive pricing pressure. Without multiple bidders, there is reduced assurance that the government received best value.

`[RULE]`

### [HIGH] Non-Competitive Awards — PARKDALE ADVANCED MATERIALS, INC.

**What:** 100.0% of awards (by count) to PARKDALE ADVANCED MATERIALS, INC. were non-competitive, totaling $543,407,710.52 across 2 awards.

**Standard:** FAR 6.302 permits non-competitive procurement only under specific circumstances (sole source, urgency, national security). OECD Guidelines (2025) flag persistent non-competitive patterns as a procurement integrity indicator.

**Impact:** $543,407,710.52 in awards bypassed competition. While individual justifications may be valid, the cumulative pattern reduces the transparency and competitiveness of the procurement portfolio.

### [HIGH] Price Outliers — 70FB7020F00000080 (PARKDALE ADVANCED MATERIALS, INC.)

**What:** Award 70FB7020F00000080 valued at $532,157,710.52 is a statistical outlier (z-score: 56.80) within its NAICS/PSC category.

**Standard:** Statistical pricing analysis per OECD bid rigging guidelines. Awards exceeding 1.5x IQR above Q3 or z-score > 2.0 are flagged for price reasonableness review. FAR 15.404 requires price analysis for contract actions.

**Impact:** An award valued significantly above comparable procurements may indicate insufficient price negotiation or lack of competitive pricing pressure. Total exposure: $532,157,710.52.

`[RULE]`

### [HIGH] Vendor Concentration — AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE, INC.

**What:** AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE, INC. received 100.0% of total spending, totaling $377,437,190.32 across 35 awards.

**Standard:** The EU Single Market Scoreboard tracks vendor concentration as a key procurement health indicator. Vendor shares exceeding 30% warrant review for market diversity. FAR 6.101 promotes full and open competition to prevent vendor lock-in.

**Impact:** Concentration of $377,437,190.32 with one vendor creates dependency risk and reduces competitive pricing leverage. Disruption to this vendor could significantly impact operations.

*35 awards, $377,437,190.32 total value*

`[RULE]`

### [HIGH] Non-Competitive Awards — HANESBRANDS INC.

**What:** 100.0% of the award (by count) to HANESBRANDS INC. was non-competitive, totaling $175,000,000 across 1 award.

**Standard:** FAR 6.302 permits non-competitive procurement only under specific circumstances (sole source, urgency, national security). OECD Guidelines (2025) flag persistent non-competitive patterns as a procurement integrity indicator.

**Impact:** $175,000,000 in awards bypassed competition. While individual justifications may be valid, the cumulative pattern reduces the transparency and competitiveness of the procurement portfolio.

*Industry: MEDICAL, DENTAL, AND HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES MERCHANT WHOLESALERS · 1 award in dataset · active 2020-04-21 to 2020-04-21*

## Next Steps

- **R001:** Review solicitation practices and advertisement reach for single-bid awards
- **R002:** Verify sole-source justifications (J&A documents) for top non-competitive awards
- **R006:** Compare prices with similar procurements from other agencies
- **R004:** Check SAM.gov entity type (FFRDC/UARC) and assess vendor diversification

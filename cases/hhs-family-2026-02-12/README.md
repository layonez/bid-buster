# Procurement Investigation: Department of Health and Human Services → Family Endeavors

**Period:** 2021-01-01 to 2022-12-31
**Generated:** 2026-02-12

Between January 2021 and December 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded Family Endeavors, Inc. three contracts totaling approximately $2.01 billion, with all three awards executed through non-competitive procedures. This procurement pattern represents 100% non-competitive contracting with a single vendor over the two-year period, a level of sole-source reliance that warrants additional review of the justification documentation and competitive feasibility assessments. The dollar magnitude—exceeding $2 billion—and complete absence of competitive awards in this vendor relationship suggests this case merits examination of whether emergency authorities or unique capability determinations were appropriately applied. This screening identifies the pattern for further administrative review to ensure compliance with federal competition requirements.

## Top Findings

### [HIGH] Non-Competitive Awards — FAMILY ENDEAVORS, INC.

**What:** 100.0% of awards (by count) to FAMILY ENDEAVORS, INC. were non-competitive, totaling $2,013,664,365.4 across 3 awards.

**Standard:** FAR 6.302 permits non-competitive procurement only under specific circumstances (sole source, urgency, national security). OECD Guidelines (2025) flag persistent non-competitive patterns as a procurement integrity indicator.

**Impact:** $2,013,664,365.4 in awards bypassed competition. While individual justifications may be valid, the cumulative pattern reduces the transparency and competitiveness of the procurement portfolio.
